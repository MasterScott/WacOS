# About AMD processor (64 bit) support on WacOS

---

Why AMD?
-----------

Normal Mac computers do not use AMD processors. There is a growing number of AMD users due to its low cost and high performance when compared to Intel processors, and also its openness. I want WacOS to support different architectures, and not just be limited to 1 dominant architecture. AMD is very good, and it would be worth trying to get support for AMD processors on WacOS

Programming
-----------

I am currently unsure how to program AMD drivers. More info coming soon
