# About PowerPC support on WacOS

---

WacOS will have legacy PowerPC support, but it is recommended to keep this in a Virtual Machine (by the time this is released)
The PowerPC architecture is really out of date (it has been abandoned for over a decade) and there might be dangerous hardware exploits for people using real hardware for this. This will also add compatibility for certain MacOS programs that are specifically designed for this architecture

What language to use?
-----------

I have been doing research on the languages supported by PowerPC. My guesses are that the following languages are likely supported:

> Assembly

> C
