# About Intel 86x architecture for WacOS

---

This section is the place for Intel 32 bit drivers for WacOS. It is recommended that when WacOS begins development, usage stays in a virtual machine.

---

As of May 27th 2020, I am still deciding on how to write the drivers. I currently have 3 langauge options"

> 1. Assembly
> 2. C
> 3. Intel Hex (Binary data)

**Options are listed in A-Z order**

---

Drivers won't be written for a long time, as I don't even have a bootable system yet, or even a monolithic kernel (Linux) set up yet.
